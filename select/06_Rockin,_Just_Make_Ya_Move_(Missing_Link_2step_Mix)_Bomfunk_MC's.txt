That's how it goes, symbiose
For those who are down
'Nuff respect to the pioneers
Who brought us the sound

We still keep rocking on and on
To the break of day
Stay feeling good like you know you should
Let me hear you say

We came to rock the party
So come on everybody
Pull up to the bumper, baby
Groove with the bumps that make you crazy

This is how we do the do
Rocking just to make ya move
So pull up to the bumper, baby
Groove with the bumps that make you crazy

Fanatic, we're mad it
'Cos to have it that B-Boy style
Tremendous, eventious
You'll see us on a mission worldwide

Crowd of people gemmin' and jam
Ready to get tha loose
Sound selector behind the set
Hit tha turbo boost

We want the action, satisfaction
Reached to the max
With funky breaks, boogie down grooves
Dudes for kangol hats

We came to rock the party
So come on everybody
Pull up to the bumper, baby
Groove with the bumps that make you crazy
