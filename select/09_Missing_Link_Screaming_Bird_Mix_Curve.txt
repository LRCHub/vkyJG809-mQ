I had a heart, but I buried it someplace
I had a brain, but my body, it won the race
I dream in pictures, pictures of you
A figure of eight just won't do
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

You picked the fruit that gave you a sweet taste
You walk the tightrope, unwilling to see straight
You pick me up, then you pull me down
Made up your mind that I'm the clown
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Accidentally, we talked about the past
Accidentally, we talked about the past
Accidentally, we talked about the past
Accidentally, we talked too much

Was it magic that redefined?
The missing link to blow your mind

You had a dream and you thought it religious
You had a taste and it made it contagious
It picks you up, then it spits you out
It makes you know what it's all about
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Accidentally, we walked away too fast
Accidentally, we walked away too fast
Accidentally, we walked away too fast
Accidentally, we took too much

Was it magic that redefined?
The missing link to blow your mind

Accidentally, we talked about the past
Accidentally, we talked about the past
Accidentally, we talked about the past
Accidentally, we took too much

Was it magic that redefined?
The missing link to blow your mind
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Was there tragedy in all we we did?
Now I know there's no place for it
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Was it magic that redefined
The missing link to blow your mind
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Was there tragedy in the things we did?
Now I know there's no place for it
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
